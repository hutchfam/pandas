#Observation:
#1.Schools with a larger population of students are more vunerable for lower passing grades. 
#When the teacher to student ratio is smaller, grades improve and mitigate failing grades.
#This is shown by the school size. Smaller populated schools have a much higher overall passing rate than 
#schools with a large population. 

#2.Dispite the size of the schools, the budget per student are close to even for all schools. 
#Funding is not a concern with greade performance. 
#This is shown by the budget by size. This illustrates that lower funded schools have better overall passing rates. 

#3.Charter Schools have a significant higher passing scores than district schools. 

#4.Schools should consider either separating larger schools into smaller schools.
# School boards should also consider to change all district type schools into all charter schools. 
#Charter schools focus on the strengths of each student. 
#District schools use a known failing teaching system that is more of a "cookie cutter" education 
#for all students.
